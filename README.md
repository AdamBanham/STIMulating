# STIMulating

## Goals
Purpose of this project is to produce a searching platform for resources for PLFs to access.
By using a few key terms , resources will be shown to the user that are similar or match their needs.

### Resource Managament

Previously , these resources have been placed behind blackboard networks in a community , afer several links. 
These resources would get lost and forgotten as soon as the key resource would move. The goal for creating this 
single channel resource will combine all these resources , provide statistics about the usage of each resource ,
a reviewing system for resources and the ability to create new resources on the platform.

### Personal Development Encouragement System

Hopefully this will also allow for PLF development tracking and a gamification system to encourage not only the mentoring 
scheme for STIMulate but also to allow for PLF through creating resources , providing insights from assignments and creating
new workshops for PLF that have a lower workload in the mentoring system. The overall goal of this portion is to create a
more complete experience for members to find development oppportunities , providing a framework for getting certificates for 
parcapiates , offer more to lower interaction members and finally improve the expereince for entering PLF into the programme.
